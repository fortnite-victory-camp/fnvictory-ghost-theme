# Fortnite Victory Camp theme for Ghost

Beginning of the FVC website. Starting with free tutorials, so a Ghost blog makes sense.
The theme is a modified version of the default theme (Casper) for the open-source [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) blogging platform.

Made with ❤️ in California. Hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

To dev & run:

1. Run a local copy of Ghost, make sure the theme is active
2. Make sure sass is running `sass --watch assets/sass/core.scss:assets/css/styles.css`
3. ???
4. Profit. That's it :) view the http://localhost:2368 that Ghost is running at, and play with theme.
